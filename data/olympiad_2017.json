    "content": "One morning, Riya woke up to find strange footprints in her garden. The footprints were small, round, and seemed to go in circles around her favorite rose bush. Curious, Riya decided to investigate. She measured the footprints and compared them to those of her cat, but they were much smaller. She asked her neighbors if they had seen anything unusual, but no one had. That night, Riya stayed up late, watching the garden from her window. Just as the clock struck midnight, she saw a tiny hedgehog waddling around the rose bush, leaving behind the same round footprints. Riya smiled, happy to have solved the mystery.",
